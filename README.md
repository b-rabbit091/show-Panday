## Favorite Food: Pizza

Momo is my favorite food because of its  **delicious taste** and **versatility** as it can be used as a meal or a snack.

## Where to Get Momo

1. **Street Food Vendors** (Quickest to find, especially in cities and towns)
2. **Specialty Momo Restaurants** (Great for a more refined momo experience, often with different varieties such as veg and chicken)
3. **Supermarkets** (Frozen momos that can be quickly cooked at home)

- **Tibetan-style fried potatoes**
