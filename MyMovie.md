## Why I Love Interstellar

Interstellar is one of my favorite movies because it mixes an exciting space adventure with a very touching, personal story. The way it shows the bond between people, even across huge distances and time, is amazing. The movie also shows how important science, family, and hope are in a way that feels both real and magical.
